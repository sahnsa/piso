## Update

This website project is updated regularly, with the addition of essential functionalities and features to enhance user interaction and experience. These improvements are largely based on research aimed at addressing specific user needs, ensuring they have the best possible online experience.

## Future Plan

Having grown fond of Drupal as my preferred platform for building websites and other digital solutions, the process of integrating Drupal into this portfolio website has begun. Although still in the initial stages of planning and designing the overall UX/UI experience, the ultimate aim is to transition to the Drupal platform as soon as feasible, to capitalize on Drupal's extensive functionalities and capabilities.

## Technology

This portfolio website utilizes modern web technologies to offer users a richer experience. Among the technologies used: JavaScript/jQuery, HTML5 + CSS3, SASS, MySQL, and WordPress. I am preparing to move this to Drupal entirely.
